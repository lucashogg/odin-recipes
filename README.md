## About

> 1. It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
> 2. Remember the Recipe page you created as practice from the HTML Foundations section? Well, it’s rather plain looking, isn’t it? Let’s fix that by adding some CSS to it!

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a simple a website consisting of a few pages containing recipe instructions. This exercise is intended to help with HTML and CSS basics.
