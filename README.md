## About

> Itâ€™s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a simple a website consisting of a few pages containing recipe instructions. This exercise is intended to help with HTML basics.

_Note: CSS will be added in a later assignment. This README will be updated to reflect that change._
