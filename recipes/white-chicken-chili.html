    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>White Chicken Chili is one of mine and my wife's favorite meals to make when the weather starts to cool down
        later in the year. We always look forward to soup and chili season!</p>
    <p>This meal is great because it's extremely simple to prepare and only takes about 30 minutes to cook. Perfect for
        a weeknight dinner!</p>
